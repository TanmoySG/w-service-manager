# Development Planning Tracker

This documentation will contain the development planning/stages for service-manager. The development activities will be divided in sub-working stages based on the components
- service-onboarding - to onboard a service on to wPlatform and wIP
- service-manager (sub to service manager) - handles services and request for onboarded services
- service-initiator or provisioning - to provision service for/to a user

Planning Docs for more precise dev tracking will be added later. This is not one.

## Service Onboarding

Based on the components/sub-components of onboarding, the sub tasks (broadly) are
- service-intake
- service-audit
- service-integration

## Service Management

## Service Provisioning

# Timelines

Timeline to track the development of the sub components. These broader tasks/components will be tracked under these categories -
- Design - Designing the solution/approach
- Development - Implementation of the Design + Fixing the design
- Testing - Testing the Developed Implementation
- Deployment - Deploying the Tested Implementation
- Integration - Integration with other sibling-services/components

One more category of tracking that will be done as an additional on-requirement basis one the system is up and can be worked on for improvements and other standardization as per time in hand. These are not mandatory or in the dev lifecycle but are recommended when other tasks are done.
